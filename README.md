# Midterm - CS 6510
### *Jonah Boe, Tyler Conley, Ela Bohlourihajar, and Colton Hill*
This repository consists of the code used to complete the midterm in our Robot Intelligence course.

## [Problem 1 - Moving in a car](problem01/)
This problems deal with the control difference between Ackermann & Skid Steering, as well as the error which resulting from decreasing time-step fidelity (dt) and slip due to poor friction.

## [Problem 2 - Forward Kinematics with numerical approaches](problem02/)
This problem focuses on the use of DH parameter to compute the forward kinematics of an arm-type robot.

## [Problem 3 - Inverse Kinematics with numerical approaches](problem03)
This problem focuses on the use of ML to compute the inverse kinematics of an arm-type robot.

## [Problem 4 - Balancing a Pole](problem04/)
For this problem, we implement a QNN agent to learn a modified cart-pole environment.

## [Problem 5 - Control and Reinforcement Learning](problem05/)
This problem focuses on applications of reinforcement learning, using the Cartpole and Half-Cheetah gym environments

## [Problem 6 - Human Emotions](problem06/)
## [Problem 7 - Motion Planning](problem07/)
This problem focues on pathfinding algorithms, specifically A\*, both in a grid layout and in continuous space using random sampling

## [Problem 8 - Object Detection](problem08/)
Here, we use Facebook's `Detectron2` program to implement 3 different R-CNNs and retrain them to find a new object. These models are then tested and measured against each other.

## Problem 9 - Ethics of Robotics
This problem solution is comprised solely of tables, figures, and descriptions. No code was needed here and all required information is found in the `Report.pdf`.
