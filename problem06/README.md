# Problem 6

## Part A
### Instructions:
Open the file `Face_Emotion_Recognition_from_Videos.ipynb` in  your preferred notebook application.

## Part B:
### Instructions:

```py
python b.py
```

## Part D:
All outputs for part D are in the folder `my_output`, which contains the processed live feeds of 2 people.


## Development Process:

At first, I ran the sample code, then I placed my files (some records from myself) inside the code, both images and videos. After which I uploaded the output here in the output folder but the tables and plot placed in the report file. For other conceptual questions, I put the relevant answers in the report file.
For a short faces-recording along with the script that can read live webcam streams,b.py file has been written.
