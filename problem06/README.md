## Development Process:

At first, I ran the sample code, then I placed my files (some records from myself) inside the code, both images and videos. After which I uploaded the output here in the output folder but the tables and plot placed in the report file. For other conceptual questions, I put the relevant answers in the report file.
For a short faces-recording along with the script that can read live webcam streams,b.py file has been written.
