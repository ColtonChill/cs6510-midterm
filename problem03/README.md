# Inverse Kinematics
This program demonstrates a robotic arm that can estimate the changes required to reach a specific target end factor position.

## Commentary:
This program uses simulated annealing in order to reach the target. The target is hard coded, and is: (x:1.2, y:0.8, z:0.5). All units are in meters, unless otherwise specified.

## Instructions:

### To run part (a):
```
python a.py
```

### To run part (b):
```
python b.py
```

### To run part (c):
```
python c.py
```
