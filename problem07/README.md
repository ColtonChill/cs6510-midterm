# Problem 7

## Part A

Part A uses an A\* algorithm to calculate the shortest path to a goal

This part requires matplotlib to be installed, which you can do with:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

To run the code for this part, you can enter the command:

```
python3 a.py
```

This will output the results to [results_A.md](./results_A.md).

## Part B

Part B illustrates the usage of a sampling-based A\* planner with a skid-steer model.


This part requires all the packages that part A requires.

You can run this code with the command:

```
python3 b.py
```

This will output the results to [results_B.md](./results_B.md).
